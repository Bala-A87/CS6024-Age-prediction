# CS6024-Age-prediction
Mini project for CS6024 - Algorithmic Approaches to Computational Biology, on the topic: Gene expression analysis for age prediction

## Dataset

We use the *Age prediction using machine learning* dataset, obtained from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/2545213). The file `training_data_normal.tsv` is used for the project. 

The dataset has not been included in the repository since it is openly available. To run the code present in the repository, please download the dataset and save it as `dataset.tsv` in a new folder `data` created in the cloned repository.

Once this is done, the directory structure would be as follows: <!-- Update as time progresses -->

```bash
.
├── code
│   └── ...
├── data
│   └── dataset.tsv
├── Proposal.pdf
└── README.md
```
